        "description": "Primarily, there are three chest muscles involved in movement: the pectoralis major, the pectoralis minor, and the serratus anterior. Pectoral muscles are most predominantly associated with movement of the shoulders and arms. When working together, they provide stability for bone structures such as the clavicle (collar bone) and the scapula (shoulder). Muscles of the chest enable us to lift, extend, and rotate our arms, along with playing a part in the process of respiration. Chest muscles are required in order to carry out everyday activities like moving furniture, lifting heavy objects, pitching a baseball, and stretching our arms.",

      "description": "Primarily, there are three chest muscles involved in movement: the pectoralis major, the pectoralis minor, and the serratus anterior. Pectoral muscles are most predominantly associated with movement of the shoulders and arms. When working together, they provide stability for bone structures such as the clavicle (collar bone) and the scapula (shoulder). Muscles of the chest enable us to lift, extend, and rotate our arms, along with playing a part in the process of respiration. Chest muscles are required in order to carry out everyday activities like moving furniture, lifting heavy objects, pitching a baseball, and stretching our arms.",

Pectoral muscles are most predominantly associated with movement of the shoulders and arms.

      "description": "Primarily, there are three chest muscles involved in movement: the pectoralis major, the pectoralis minor, and the serratus anterior. Pectoral muscles are most predominantly associated with movement of the shoulders and arms. When working together, they provide stability for bone structures such as the clavicle (collar bone) and the scapula (shoulder). Muscles of the chest enable us to lift, extend, and rotate our arms, along with playing a part in the process of respiration. Chest muscles are required in order to carry out everyday activities like moving furniture, lifting heavy objects, pitching a baseball, and stretching our arms.",
